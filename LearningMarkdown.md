# Tech Tacos: Using Mardown in GitHub

Both LaTeX and Markdown are examples of markup language. Today, we'll be learning how to use Markdown, an easy programming language that helps make clean formatting on multiple platforms.

## What is Markup?

A markup language is a system that uses *tags* to define and annotate the structure and presentation of a document. These tags can include anything from simple **emphasis** to making headings and lists to inserting extras like links or pictures.

Have you heard of HTML, the code that helps create webpages? The letters stand for **Hypertext Markup Language**. HTML is just one example of a markup language. A few others include XML (helps websites with more data intensive applications), LaTeX (used in writing academic papers), and Markdown (what we're learning today!).

Markup languages very common because they are relatively easy to use and provide standardized definitions of various formatting elements, making it easier for computers and software applications to interpret and display the content correctly. 
This can ensure similar quality between displaying text on different screens, different browsers, etc.
